951,1abff8f3c01fdafd3bcd19f87c394ce4,-3,-1,sometimes
1136,e00a907093d3662aa176f39e14952433,-3,-1,"No, I think by concentrating on the if statements you will miss the big picture solutions."
1195,5857532ecc165a002982034e30107bdf,-3,-1,Probably. Programmers love to use cases and that's a natural way of breaking up answers.
1248,d1a66d7119f95c8f2c9361ec9f55a951,-3,-1,"If a solution only works for specific platforms or technologies, such as ""If you're using Java..."", highlighting that text might help me quickly find posts that fit my specific needs, or filter out posts that aren't relevant."
1299,e65bb7c765458b48e9ecc690c047e57e,-3,-1,Possibly. Again it depends if you are using the same stack as the user when developing
1502,5ae06be6dd4e8581d5c90c40188c4897,-3,-1,It may help as the answer may change based on those.
1760,86a32f171475d4ad42af11c4cbb1eaf1,-3,-1,No.
1860,a3f1676dc2e47d8d53c2a7c129a67b30,-3,-1,I think that it could easily help people find the information that they needed. 
1882,008b58b84d46a50e0332032e0d3d9e3a,-3,-1,Yes it might be relevant.
1902,d6cef22e92c1343285684a3e993e6bd3,-3,-1,"It might. It might be nice to have some granularity to the highlighting that a user could specify. (i.e. Do you want to highlight x, y, z?) "
1912,7f9418fde2cfedcdde148dbdbb94d5fe,-3,-1,Yes
2339,c0987233440ef3ca8ad15efbe319b9fe,-3,-1,"only if all the variations were also highlighted eg if you have java do this, C# do this etc"
2484,2a8581d33179ed475cf9cfcada387e57,-3,-1,yes of course !
2656,1bd1c455f2839dc7cbc6251537f3da8c,-3,-1,I completely agree . Those highlighted sentences are really useful
2754,b5c68f66246b451c0f65518977e7a241,-3,-1,Possibly but not all the time.
2837,3e51e4b28d98fafdb6af2a476e01ca7a,-3,-1,no
2980,5c1e42105e8b0f72d95a7580f24fb393,-3,-1,"Yeah, these conditional statements will give you an idea if the info is applicable to you or not. "
3192,1e291d9f8c99470ffa480486a34873f5,-3,-1,"Yes, being able to find these without having to sift through a ton of responses would be very helpful."
3294,46a48d98a47aeb653879015c3361fa64,-3,-1,no. i find those to be extraneous.
3902,190b2cf87a5569b0aa93aacda8da876a,-3,-1,"They could be, but usually people use the tags for posts if they need it to be about a specific language or technology. Highlighting information about operating systems would be very helpful though because sometimes that can make a big difference."
4333,c53ab511afc9daa4c139b32cfb3911df,-3,-1,"Yes, absolutely. If clause often points out a major part of what's happening in the code."
4763,567145b16da60b17212073e933b46886,-3,-1,"Yes, because it would clue me in to areas that may be somewhat confusing at first, resulting in becoming more proficient in the language in question."
5004,b0b07d3a799b71ba702f4c5da29f27b9,-3,-1,"Knowing a solution is specific to a technology, etc. will let me quickly decide if I should continue reading or look elsewhere."
5147,dc6630e697579eeb3bb390355349868b,-3,-1,Yes. That information will also help
5496,11e321cebd307d56075b6bf9ca4248c7,-3,-1,No
5502,5e1008f67932df8c7b022882d312205d,-3,-1,"No,  I'd prefer general solutions. "
5743,57dd37df7c9b09ff65cdf930d2a600ed,-3,-1,"Yes, as there many factors that are implied, those conditional sentences may help to locate the problem."
5888,340e8782e70cce8dbf3be406e1ef505e,-3,-1,"Sure, the programming language is most relevant"
5952,4147da6320a499a7706a4cb34679ceae,-3,-1,yes. i will be very useful
6032,9e474d6b2dda6f02fe5a5381b2ae7dd1,-3,-1,probably
6553,7a950c0d4743490af403d1b63f6735d6,-3,-1,"I don't think so, they seem too contextual"
6691,40911285d6743fcd280b5badd29bd31c,-3,-1,Yes if it is directly related to something the question asks.
6913,36d239cfa27dd388296579a4d24afb15,-3,-1,"Yes, it helps me in figuring out whether that particular solution is relevant or not."
7057,0f6f9cc0bcb338401e6e9ad2aac3aa7f,-3,-1,"some, yes, others no. See above reasons."
7160,a95f5fba5e1b799bd7aa667fb1c5cd08,-3,-1,"If my user profile states that I use that language or system, or if I have entered that language or system in my search that got me to the answer in question, yes.  If not, then most likely no."
7225,94269079ab46deae14277decb3e44399,-3,-1,"I would be neutral for this question. Because, not all the programmers or developers could identify what actually the given code does. "
7531,2ebf68fd3883774de5aeeaafdefae460,-3,-1,Yes.
7595,e0189a864102ab9974837b37cb0f2c9d,-3,-1,They could be if they are promoting solutions or unseen problems the poster did not realize.
7809,437132e2719f79b06bcc330b5c8d827b,-3,-1,"Honestly, no."
7882,aed31d20356f4f21667630fbaf6d6f11,-3,-1,Not really - conditional sentences are probably only helpful if you satisfy the conditions in the first place
8046,eb47749ec4c3a53610bd5bc502cc6672,-3,-1,not at first but maybe
